Thank you for clicking on this link.
The reality is that it's hard to know what was generated here versus what was actually written by me. Most of the text on this website was edited using ChatGPT, but I did organize it into a single page showcasing who I am as a person. This raises the question of what makes us human versus computers. As of today, AIs can't make a website pay for codex on GitHub, clone a repo template of Jekyll, and then simplify it to a version that only contains information about me.

I acknowledge ChatGPT and Stability AI for finally unblocking my journey in website creation. I started this project a couple of months ago, but was blocked by copyright issues with pictures and also learning a new programming language. All of the images on the website were made with Dream Studio, and ChatGPT helped me debug this site. 

A real image of me with the bots:
